            <h2>Game Rules</h2>
            <p>
                Objective: Score the most points by strategically placing your pieces on the board and capturing your opponent's pieces. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Game Components: A 9x9 game board with one designated "deadzone" (a randomly placed gray square). Two sets of game pieces, one for each player. Each set contains: 5 pieces of each number from 2 to 8. 1 King (K) 1 Queen (Q) 1 Bishop (B) 3 Aces (A) Game Setup: Random Deadzone: At the start of the game, one square on the 9x9 board is randomly designated as the "deadzone" (gray square). No pieces can be placed in this square. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Gameplay: On your turn, you must place one piece from your piece bank onto an empty square on the game board. You can do this by: Clicking on a piece in your bank, then clicking on an empty square on the board or dragging a piece from your bank and dropping it onto an empty square.  
            <p>
                Move Validation: Numbered Pieces (2-8): These pieces follow Sudoku rules. You cannot place a number in a row, column, or 3x3 square if that number already exists there. King (K), Queen (Q), Bishop (B): These special pieces cannot be placed in a row, column, or 3x3 square if another special piece (K, Q, or B) is already there. The Bishop also cannot be placed on a diagonal if there is another special piece on the diagonal. Ace (A): The Ace is a wild card. It can be placed on any square, including the deadzone, regardless of the other pieces on the board. Scoring: Numbered Pieces: The score value is the number on the piece. King (K): 50 points. Queen (Q): No immediate points, but it has capture abilities. Bishop (B): No immediate points, but it has capture abilities. Ace (A): 1 point, unless there is a King in the same row, column, or 3x3 square, in which case it is worth 11 points. If a king is placed, any aces in the same row, column, or square are updated to be worth 11 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Special Piece Abilities: Queen (Q): Captures all opponent pieces in the same row, column, and 3x3 square. King (K): Captures all opponent pieces in the eight adjacent squares. Bishop (B): Captures all opponent pieces along the two diagonals it occupies. Capturing: When you capture an opponent's piece, you gain its point value, and your opponent loses it. The captured piece becomes yours. Row, Column, and Square Conversions: If you fill an entire row, column, or 3x3 square with your pieces, you capture all opponent pieces within that row, column, or square. King Capture: If a player captures the opponent's King, the game ends immediately, and the capturing player wins. Game End: The game ends when one player captures the opponent's King. The player with the highest score wins. Important Notes: The "deadzone" cannot have any pieces placed on it except an ace. Once a King is placed, all Aces in the same row, column or square are worth 11 points. Aces are wild cards, and can be placed anywhere. If an Ace is captured, it's score is determined by if there is a king in the same row, column or square at the time of capture. Have fun playing Dulko!
